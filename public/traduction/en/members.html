                                <h2>Myoelectric prosthesis</h2>
                                <h3>What are these?</h3>
                                <p>Myoelectric prosthesis are use for arms amputation </p>
                                <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                                <p>The price of these prosthesis is 50000$ compare to mechanical prosthesis that cost between 300000 and 400000$</p>
                                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                                <p> Myoelectric prosthesis are controlled by electromagnetic signal which happen when you move your muscle. The electrodes to detect these are usually place on the skin.</p>
                                <h3>The direct control of prosthesis</h3>
                                <p>For the direct control electrodes will register signals to register freedom degrees. These signals are compared to predetermined numbers and action are determined in function of the parameters of the prosthesis.The prosthesis need different parameters to allow differents move .</p>
                                <h3>Proportional controll</h3>
                                <p>It allow to control the speed of moves proportionaly to the power of the signal.This control is done by comparing the predetermined signal and the one we receive.</p>
                                <h3>Is there other way to control prosthesis?</h3>
                                <p>Yes of course the one realised in 2013 using pattern recognition is more useful.But it actualy need a lot of training for the user to use it. </p>
                                <h3>Why such a control?</h3>
                                <p>This control alow to do natural moves and with time it become more easy and allow more freedom degrees</p>
                                <h3>How it is powered?</h3>
                                <p>Elle peut être muni de piles rechargeables permettant son fonctionnement. </p>
                                <h3>Prosthesis exemple</h3>

                                <h3>How to compare amputate people and not amputate people?</h3>
                                <img alt="courbe" class="img" src="../../images/courbe.png" title="courbe">
                                <p> To compare we decompose their steps to compare it to those of able-bodied people. The red curve represents that of the maputes and the gray curve that of the non-amputees. We note that there is little difference between amputees and non-amputees.</p>
                                <h3>The heel</h3>
                                <img alt="heel" class="img" src="../../images/talon.png" title="talon">
                                <p>For information, the heel has a small greasy cushion depicted in blue on the image allowing the impact on the heel and the ground to be emanated.</p>
                                <h3>The steps of the walk</h3>
                                <p>Step 1: The foot gradually stretches and is retained by the muscles at the front of the leg</p>
                                <p>Step 2: The feet sag, the tendons stretch</p>
                                <p>Step 3: The leg wraps around the ankle and goes from back to front. The movement is retained by the calf muscles.</p>
                                <p>Step 4: The heel takes off and the foot wraps around the toes and the calf muscles lift the leg while his twin sister starts the same choreography</p>
                                <p>So here are the steps of the walk, but I know what you think: How can such a basic prosthesis reproduce such a complex movement? Well thanks to its profile and its materials. A material that has the particularity to deform and return to its initial shape quickly is what is called a shape memory material.
                                    Then the flexibility of the material allows to tilt the leg from back to front and when the whole weight of the person no longer rests on the prosthesis, the material can return to its original shape by releasing the stored energy which allows as you see take off the heel and then the foot
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It's crazy what you ask for a knee prosthesis. To take the measurement let us take a step further towards the existing prostheses because as you see, it is necessary to replace all the complex part allowing the control of the leg. </p>
                                <h2> Example of a leg prosthesis</h2>
                                <h3>The carbon blade</h3>
                                <img alt="lame" class="img" src="../../images/lame.png" title="lame">
                                <p>To run carbon blade does a bit like a spring. So we could say that it is an advantage but this spring effect is multiplied by 1 for the best blades and by 2.5 for the human foot.</p>
                                <h3>The microprocessor knee</h3>
                                <img alt="genou" class="img" src="../../images/genou.png" title="genou">
                                <h3>How it works?</h3>
                                <p>The microprocessor knee is equipped with sensors at the heel and knee. </p>
                                <h3>What are the sensors for?</h3>
                                <p>And be aware that the faster you walk, the greater the impact on the heel. The intensity of the shock is therefore measured and the data is transmitted to the microprocessors of the knee which adapts the flow rate at the piston as a function of the intensity of the shock. The more shock, the more flow and the less the leg is retained. The knee also benefits from angle sensors to measure the opening and closing angle. We slow down the movement of the prosthesis from a certain angle to prevent it from going too far</p>
                                <h3>Comfort issues</h3>
                                <p>These prostheses are used to walk step by step at a constant speed.</p>
                                <h3>Hydraulic knees</h3>
                                <p>This prosthetic knee is equipped with a hydraulic system, a kind of piston allowing to control the extension and flexion movements and to slow down when necessary. The hydraulic unit is used to make the throwing movement of the leg more natural.</p>
                                <h3>Example of a modern knee prosthesis</h3>
                                <h3>Powerknee</h3>
                                <img alt="powerKnee" class="img" src="../../images/powerKnee.png" title="powerKnee">
                                <p>It costs 60,000 euros and allows normal walking but needs to be recharged every day. </p>
                                <h3>Here are now several types of prostheses for those who have great knowledge in medicine</h3>

                            <p>
                                In order to develop the subject of artificial organs, one must already know what an artificial organ consists of. An organ is a part of a living being with a specific function to allow it to live. Thanks to new technologies, advanced engineering and the rise of medicine, many organs can benefit from an artificial equivalent. They are one of the great solutions to the problems encountered in the field of replacement of deficient organs, because we are starting to meet the limits of transplantation. Between the lack of greiffons and the inconsistency between a donor and a recipient, this is why some people begin to consider henceforth artificial organs as an alternative to grafting. </p>
                            <p>
                                Prospects are being studied or may emerge in the near future, but the review to assess the side effects is not yet sufficient and the cost of these new devices is not negligible, even if the The advent of IT can reduce costs via 3D printing in particular. </p>
                            <p>
                                For 50 years, research on artificial organs has not stopped progressing, offering a real alternative to transplantation and a better quality of life for patients. From pacemaker to hearing aid, it has been a while since the injury progresses, even if the total replacement of an organ and not more than one part of the organ has been seriously considered only for some time, making fiction a reality . This growing interest is linked to better biocompatibility of materials as well as increased miniaturization of devices. </p>

                            <p>
                                We will now see for each organ in particular certain artificial organs which are distinguished by their successes.

                                    <h3>Carmat Heart</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        A real medical feat that required more than 15 years of research, Carmat is probably the most complete total artificial heart prosthesis in the world, and aims to be a lasting treatment solution for end-stage heart failure due to the lack of human grafts. 
                                           <br>
                                            By hydraulic actuation via two miniature motor pump groups, the actuating liquid displaces this biomembrane by reproducing the movement of the ventricular wall of the human heart during contraction. This movement causes admission and ejection of blood. An on-board electronic device regulates the functioning of the prosthesis according to the needs of patients from information given by sensors and processed by a microprocessor, to obtain the necessary blood flow without systematically increasing the operating frequency.
                                            The Carmat prosthesis is divided into 3 parts: <br>
                                            1. The Peoth implanted inside the patient, in place of his deficient heart. It contains all the elements necessary for the regulation of blood flow. <br>
                                            2. The Patient Mobile KiT provides the mobility and autonomy essential for a life close to normal. It consists of a controller and lithium-ion batteries ensuring an autonomy of more than 5 hours. <br>
                                            3.Hospital Care Console allows the medical team to pilot the prosthesis during implantation and to monitor it.

                                    <p>
                                        Known as TAH: Total Artificial Heart or CardioWest, the SynCardia total heart is the most widely used prosthesis, with satisfactory post-transplant results to be confirmed.
                                        <br>Existing for 25 years, TAH is today experiencing a new development with the advent of the Companion and Freedom mobile consoles, allowing autonomy and an excellent quality of life for patients assisted by TAH and awaiting heart transplantation, granting them a lot more freedom of movement towards hospitals. <br>
                                        From 1969 to 2014, there were 1,413 artificial hearts implanted worldwide.

                                    <p>
                                        It was in the early 2000s that a team of researchers from the universities of San Francisco began to develop the artificial kidney project. This project could become a real boon for patients suffering from kidney failure, in particular for those who are in the terminal stage and who have no other solution than a treatment for chronic dyalise. And it is not all seen that the director of the project, Dr. Roy, is on the right track to achieve a prosthesis in continuous and independent function. A real tailor-made kidney! <br>
                                        And this project would especially be extremely well received for the 75,000 kidney seekers in the United States alone, who have no other recourse than continuous dyalises.

                                        One of the most popular prostheses in the ocular field right now is the Argus II from Second Sight. <br>
                                        The camera attached to the glasses captures the video images then transmits the electrical stimulation data to the implant via a telemetric link from the antenna. The cable connects the glasses to the video processing unit. The ARGUS II video processing unit is powered by a battery and is connected to the glasses via a cable. This unit processes the video signal from the glasses camera and transforms it into electrical stimulation data. This stimulation data is then transmitted to the antenna of the glasses. Here is for the technical part. <br>
                                        For the moment, the results of Second Sight have been very satisfactory since people with casi cesity can discern shapes such as a silhouette or a door. More than hoping that in the near future, Argus II or an eye prosthesis will bring some color to their lives.

                                    <h2>What is a neuroprosthesis?</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        According to the studies presented today at Neuroscience 2017, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience and the world's largest source of emerging information related to the brain and health sciences, advanced limb prostheses and eyes and brain-machine interfaces use existing neural circuits to improve the quality of life for people with sensory impairments.

                                    <p>
                                        Millions of people around the world are unable to use their bodies or their senses fully due to illness, injury or amputation. At best, modern therapies and prostheses only partially restore function. Over the past 20 years, advances in biomedical engineering have led to the development of interfaces between prosthetic devices, the nervous system and human tissue, which improve the efficiency of biomedical devices.

                                    <h2>What is a Direct Neural Interface?</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Research on INDs began in the 1970s at the University of California at Los Angeles, funded in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Apparently, this is just another method of human-machine interaction, but in fact we are faced with something truly revolutionary.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At the beginning, it was only chimpanzees which articulated robots by the inclination for bananas thanks to sensors on their skulls. But today, we are getting far away. Simply put, the human neural system generates, transmits and processes electrochemical signals in different parts of the body. The "electrical part" of these signals can be "read" and "interpreted" by a computer which understands the signals given by the brain and acts accordingly.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are different ways to do this. For example, you can collect signals via magnetic resonance imaging. It is also possible to inject special liquid markers to activate the process, but they can be harmful to the human body. Finally, it is also possible to use tiny sensors. Direct neural interfaces generally use this type of sensor.
